# Manachar's Algorithm

Manacher's algorithm is a very handy algorithm with a short implementation that
can make many programming tasks, such as finding the number of palindromic substrings
or finding the longest palindromic substring, very easy and efficient. The running
time of Manacher's algorithm is *O(N)* where *N*  is the length of the input string.

## Implementation

Let:

1. s be a string of N characters

2. s2 be a derived string of s, comprising N * 2 + 1 elements, with each element
corresponding to one of the following: the N characters in s, the N-1 boundaries
among characters, and the boundaries before and after the first and last character
respectively

3. A boundary in s2 is equal to any other boundary in s2 with respect to element
matching in palindromic length determination

4. p be an array of palindromic span for each element in s2, from center to either
outermost element, where each boundary is counted towards the length of a palindrome
(e.g. a palindrome that is three elements long has a palindromic span of 1)

5. c be the position of the center of the palindrome currently known to include a
boundary closest to the right end of s2 (i.e., the length of the palindrome = p[c]*2+1)

6. r be the position of the right-most boundary of this palindrome (i.e., r = c + p[c])

7. i be the position of an element (i.e., a character or boundary) in s2 whose palindromic
span is being determined, with i always to the right of c

8. i2 be the mirrored position of i around c (e.g., {i, i2} = {6, 4}, {7, 3}, {8, 2},â€¦ when c = 5 (i.e., i2 = c * 2 - i)
