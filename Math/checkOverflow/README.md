Given two integer a and b, find whether their product (a x b) exceed the signed 64 bit integer or not. If it exceed print Yes else print No. 

Approach :

1. If either of the number is 0, then it will never exceed the range.
2. Else if the product of the two divided by one equals the other, then also it will be in range.
3. In any other case overflow will occur.
