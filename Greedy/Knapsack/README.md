# 0-1 Knapsack Problem
-------------------------
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Knapsack.svg)

  The knapsack problem or **rucksack problem** is a problem in *combinatorial optimization* : Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

  ## Applications
  -----------------------------
  Knapsack problems appear in real-world decision-making processes in a wide variety of fields:
  * Finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials
  * Selection of investments and portfolios
  * Selection of assets for asset-backed securitization
  * Generating keys for the Merkleâ€“Hellman cryptosystems

## Computational Complexity
  --------
  * The decision problem form of the knapsack problem is NP-complete
  * The optimization problem is NP-hard
  * There is a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming
  * Many cases that arise in practice, and "random instances" from some distributions, can nonetheless be solved exactly
